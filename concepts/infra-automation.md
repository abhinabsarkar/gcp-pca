## Deployment Manager 
It is an infrastructure automation tool that automates the creation and management of GCP resources. Deployment Manager uses a system of templates and configuration files to document the infrastructure in an easily readable and understandable format. It conceals the actual Cloud API calls, so you don't need to write code and can focus on the definition of the infrastructure.

Features:
* Repeatable deployment process
* Declarative language
* Focus on the application
* Parallel deployment
* Template-driven

There are other infrastructure automation tools in addition to Deployment Manager that can be used in GCP like Terraform, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or Packer.
